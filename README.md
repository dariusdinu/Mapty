# Mapty

  This is an app that I have developed along a Udemy course - "The Complete JavaScript Course". Its main focus is to gain a better understanding of OOP, how to plan a Web App from start to finish and how to think and make decisions when solving a problem.
  It can be considered a running/cycling workouts manager as you can simply click on a map (that is displayed after allowing the browser to access it) and you will be prompted with a small form where you are required to input relevant data - the type, the distance, the duration and the cadence/elevation gain. After that, a marker will be rendered on a map with some details regarding your workout. The data is persistent even after closing the page and if you click on an item within the workouts list on the left, that workout will be centered in the middle of the map, setting it in focus.
